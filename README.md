## Description
Built for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course.
## Usage
To use download GITHUB repro [here](https://github.com/Jtechent/NeighborhoodProject) and navigate to project directory. copy the path to index.html and open in a browser. I added a feature to make it possible to search any neighborhood just press enter on the field if you want to ignore this and use Miami as an example. BINGO BANGO BONGO.
## Attributions
### Sources
I relied heavily on the [Google Maps Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) as well as the [Foursquare Documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/) for this project. I also used [Site Point]() at one point to solve a problem with using media queries in Javascript. Further attributions can be found in the code.
### API Usage
This site was made using the Google Maps library as well as the Foursquare API.
